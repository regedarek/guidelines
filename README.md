## Questions 

**Disturbances are toxic**. When in doubt or in need of help, please fall back to these approaches:

*"Is my question simple enough to find on Google?"*

- Yes:
	1. Then google it
	2. Google it again
	3. Ask a person in the team
- No:
	1. Try google it anyway
	2. Ask a person in the team

*"Have I thoroughly debugged this error?"*

- Yes:
	1. Ask a person in the team for an extra pair of eyes (but scope it!)
- No:
	1. Check your code again
	2. And again
	3. Do some `console.log`s
	4. Use a browser JS debugger tool
	5. Google the error messages

*Every* time you come to another person in the team with questions you could just as easy find answers for on google, you disturb this persons thought pattern and work (please refer to [this](http://ubuntuone.com/27zU9Q5Tlqkoohp6cO4sF2)).

This of course doesn't apply to deeper questions about refactoring tips and larger architectural thoughts.
